												<p>Instagram, as all of you know it as a social media app which is nowadays turning into the most viewed and time spent app next to Facebook, is not only a place for hanging out, posting your crazy pictures, and spending all your free time on it, watching unwanted posts and videos and liking it. It is also one among the platforms which is very useful for business and entrepreneurship and I was one among million others who wanted start a business out of it.</p>
												<p>But I earned only 1k followers which is not at all a big page for those of you who watch and follow posts which has 10 k-50 million followers. But I am proud that earning just 1k followers was not at all easy. If you find that I’m talking something rubbish, I challenge you to go build a new Instagram account and get at least 5k followers in a month.</p>
												<p>Here are the keys that I learnt from earning those followers on Instagram:</p>
												<p>1. Do not worry about what your parents, your friends, your bf/gf or any others think. If you are worrried about it, you’re holding yourself back in achieving your dreams.</p>
												<p>2. Just go out and try different things. If you fail, you’ll get to know that the thing you did is not the correct way to do it. Hurray! you are one step closer to a person who hasn’t even tried it. As the famous quote goes “If you learn from failures, you haven’t really lost!”.
												Success is not final, Failure is not fatal.</p>
												<p>3. If you want something from other people, you should give first and then expect from others. It all comes down to how much value you give. And not expecting anything in return is an ultimate mindset that gets you going.</p>
												<p>4. Consistency is the key. I know everybody talks about it but its hard to be consistent. And how can you be consistent? By making a daily habit to go out and do it everyday even when you aren’t in the mood of doing it. James clear says this amazing technique called ‘2 Minute Rule’. If you can do something in 2 minutes, just do it.
												Imporve everyday by being consistent.</p>
												<p>5. Don’t be too much addicted to results, it will hinder you and make you not to come back and do it again tomorrow. Just trust the process, believe something good will happen and keep doing it again and again.</p>
												<p>6. Don’t compare yourself to others. Its your life. So if you really want to compare, compare with yourself. Compare whether you are better than your last performance and if its not good, do something about it.
													Compare with yourself.
												</p>
												<p>7. Whenever you start learning something new, you’ll always be caught up in the middle with something or the other. Don’t complain. Its the lack of experience that makes you feel that you have been caught. Just work and execute. As Gary Vee says, You’re not lost, you’re just early.</p>
												<p>8. When you want to know something from a person who knows better than you, they will never tell everything they know to you until you yourself go and ask them. Approach, ask the right kind of questions, connect it with a story that happened in your life, and they will open up more than you expect.</p>

												<p>I had this curiosity back in my mind for a long time. The curiosity about why people hate their jobs, why people say ‘Office life sucks’ and why people wait for Friday evenings and live for weekends. Why this is important is that all time along, from childhood where we happen to start learning alphabets to until we get a job, we strive so hard. All the hard work we do is to get a high salary job that supports our families. And when we do get a job, at the end of the day we end up hating it.</p>
												<p>I started to look for answers for this and I luckily happened to had an interesting and amazing conversation with one of my mentors Vidyadhar(Vidyadhar Sharma). The conversation goes along like this:</p>
												<p>Me: What are your thoughts on this?</p>
												<p>Vidyadhar: Interesting. But the real question is why are people doing it despite hating it and why does everyone want to get a job in the first place.</p>
												<p>Me: Ya… Whatever…</p>
												<p>Vidyadhar: There’s something called Maslow’s Pyramid of Needs. It goes like this:</p>
												<p>The first thing that people look for is Basic Needs -Food, Shetler and Safety which is, a place to live, money to eat and keep yourself safe. Part of security is also financial security, meaning people want guaranteed finance every month to fulfill the food, shelter, and security which a job ensures.</p>
												<p>As soon as these needs are fulfilled, people need to fulfill their Self-esteem and belongingness which is the Psychological Needs. So people buy fancy stuff and do fancy stuff to fulfill their self-esteem.</p>
												<p>Once all of this is fulfilled, the last one is Self-actualisation(Self-fulfillment Needs). That is, giving meaning to life which means What you do, How you do it and Why you’re doing it. This is where everyone fails and end up being unhappy. Now you don’t need a regular job to fulfill you in all ways. You just need the right amount of everything.</p>
												<b>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</b>
												<p style="margin-top: 10px;">You need enough money for food and shelter. If you’re comfortable with uncertainty, financial security is not a big deal. And if you don’t tie your self-esteem to material things, you don’t have to spend to build self-esteem, which means you need less money. And if you have good friends and intimate relationships with people around, Self-actualisation will come by choice of choosing what makes sense to you, not for making a living.</p>
												<p>Me: Ya. Right… And if you are happy with whatever you have for now, you can be happier with whatever comes and goes in the future. So, Learning the skill of living happily and fulfilled forms a major role. What do you say?</p>
												<p>Vidyadhar: It’s not about skills. It’s about perspective and what you tie your self-esteem to. If you think that having an iPhone, A Car and Nike and a Rado is important, of-course you’re going to spend more to fulfill your self-esteem. And once you get that, you’ll want more. Self-esteem is like a Black Hole. No matter how much you fill it in, it can take more to blow your ego up.</p>
												<p>So the best thing is to not tie to material things but to intellectual things. And use the disadvantage to your advantage. So, self-esteem should be tied to how informed you are, how much you know and what you are doing with it. No matter how much you know it’s always little compared to everything there is to know, so that it’ll keep you humble. So only those who get this, bet on things that help them grow intellectually instead of financially.</p>
												<p>Me: Yeah.. Taking the positives even from the negatives. Like, however worse the situation you’re dealing with, if you have a mindset of what can you learn from the situation, what can you take away from that moment, everything changes.</p>
												<p>Vidyadhar: Mhmm… Most people who graduate out of college don’t have to go take a job to make a living. To make a living, all you need is very little. There are millions of people living below the poverty line and still alive. But I’m not saying u should fall to that. But having fine balance is important.</p>
												<p>I think the general advice to stay out of that trap is to figure out a way to earn some money from working on things you don’t love for very little time that supports what you love doing for the rest of the time.</p>
												<p>Me: Yep… If you can somehow manage to earn something and still have time to do the things you love, you’ve won.</p>
												<p>Vidyadhar: Perfect. Smart people earn loads doing what they love. That’s another level of winning.
												Work hard and Stay humble. Don’t let your egos be carried along with you.</p>
